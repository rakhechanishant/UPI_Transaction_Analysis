# 📊 UPI Transaction Analysis – Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes **UPI transaction data** to understand transaction behavior, usage patterns, and trends across multiple dimensions such as **banks, cities, devices, demographics, merchants, and payment attributes**.

The dashboard is designed to simulate a **real-world FinTech and banking analytics scenario**, enabling interactive exploration of transaction amounts, balances, and monthly trends using advanced slicers and visuals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **monthly UPI transaction trends**
- Compare **transaction amount vs remaining balance**
- Study transaction behavior across **cities and currencies**
- Understand user patterns based on **device type, age group, and gender**
- Evaluate transactions by **merchant, payment method, purpose, and transaction type**

---

## 🧩 Interactive Filters
The dashboard supports dynamic filtering using:
- Bank Name (Sent & Received)
- City
- Device Type
- Gender
- Age Groups
- Merchant Name
- Payment Method
- Transaction Purpose
- Transaction Type

These slicers allow granular, drill-down analysis across different transaction segments.
